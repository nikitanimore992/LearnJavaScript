/* if you try to print the following string , javaScript will missunderstand it 
 
 let name = Ma'am

 similarly we can use \" inside a string with double quots
 
 other escape sequence character are as follow
  \n ---> for new line
  \t ---> for tap
  \r ---> for carring Return

  let name = 'Ma\'am'
  let nm = "Ma\'am"
  let us = "Hii Nikita \n i am fine\tdude"
