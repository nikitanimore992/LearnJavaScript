<p>Beginning in 1997, JavaScript has evolved into many versions.</p>
<p>ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based!<p>

<h3>ECMAScript</h3>
<P>ECMAScript1 or ES1 was first released in 1997.</P>
<P>ECMAScript 2015 also known as ES6 was released in 2015 and a major revision to JavaScript was made.</P>
<P>The latest version of JavaScript will be ECMaScript2022 (ES13) in 2022.</P>
<p>It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript are talking about the same language.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<P>JavaScript is a lightweight, OOP language. It is a scripting language for web pages.It is used to add interactivity and dynamic effects to web pages.Nowadays used in server-side development.</P>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>In JavaScript, variables are used to store data.hey allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs. three ways you can declare a valu</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>var</li>
<li>let</li>
<li>const</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<h3>Data Type in JavaScript</h3>
<p>there are several data types that you can use to store different types of data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)</li>
<li>Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')</li>
<li>Booleans (e.g. true, false)</li>
<li>Arrays (e.g. [1, 2, 3])</li>
<li>Objects (e.g. { name: "John", age: 30 })</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Variable Naming Rules</h3>
<p>Variable names can only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.Variable names cannot start with a digit.Variable names are case-sensitive.</p>
<hr>
 
 <h3>Primitives and Objects</h3>
 <p>here are two main types of data: primitives and objects.</p>
 <h3>Primitives--></h3>
 <ul>
    <li>Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)</li>
    <li>Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')</li>
    <li>Booleans (e.g. true, false)</li>
    <li>Null (a special value that represents an absence of value)</li>
    <li>Undefined (a special value that represents an uninitialized variable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Primitives are immutable, which means that once they are created, they cannot be changed</p>
<p>For Example--<br>
    let x= 10;<br>
    x=20; // now x value is 20</p>

<br>
 <h3>-->Objects</h3>
    <p>Objects are more complex data types in JavaScript and are used to represent real-world objects or abstract concepts. They are composed of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any data type (including primitives and other objects).<br>Objects are mutable, which means that they can be changed after they are created<br>let obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };<br>obj.age = 31; // the age property of obj is now 31</p>
