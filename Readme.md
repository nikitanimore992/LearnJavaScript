<p>Beginning in 1997, JavaScript has evolved into many versions.</p>
<p>ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based!<p>

# ECMAScript
<P>ECMAScript1 or ES1 was first released in 1997.</P>
<P>ECMAScript 2015 also known as ES6 was released in 2015 and a major revision to JavaScript was made.</P>
<P>The latest version of JavaScript will be ECMaScript2022 (ES13) in 2022.</P>
<p>It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript are talking about the same language.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<P>JavaScript is a lightweight, OOP language. It is a scripting language for web pages.It is used to add interactivity and dynamic effects to web pages.Nowadays used in server-side development.</P>

# Variables
<p>In JavaScript, variables are used to store data.hey allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs. three ways you can declare a valu</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>var</li>
<li>let</li>
<li>const</li>
</ol>

# Data Type in JavaScript
<p>there are several data types that you can use to store different types of data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)</li>
<li>Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')</li>
<li>Booleans (e.g. true, false)</li>
<li>Arrays (e.g. [1, 2, 3])</li>
<li>Objects (e.g. { name: "John", age: 30 })</li>
</ul>

# Variable Naming Rules
<p>Variable names can only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.Variable names cannot start with a digit.Variable names are case-sensitive.</p>
 
 # Primitives and Objects
 <p>here are two main types of data: primitives and objects.</p>
 <h2>Primitives--></h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)</li>
    <li>Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')</li>
    <li>Booleans (e.g. true, false)</li>
    <li>Null (a special value that represents an absence of value)</li>
    <li>Undefined (a special value that represents an uninitialized variable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Primitives are immutable, which means that once they are created, they cannot be changed</p>

<br>
 <h2>-->Objects</h2>
    <p>Objects are more complex data types in JavaScript and are used to represent real-world objects or abstract concepts. They are composed of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any data type (including primitives and other objects).
    <br>
    Objects are mutable, which means that they can be changed after they are created</p>

# Operators and Expressions 
<p>Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands (values or variables). For example, the addition operator (+) adds two operands together and the assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Arithmetic operators (e.g. +, -, *, /, %)</li>
    <li>Comparison operators (e.g. >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)</li>
    <li>Logical operators (e.g. &&, ||, !)</li>
    <li>Assignment operators (e.g. =, +=, -=, *=, /=)</li>
    <li>Conditional (ternary) operator (e.g. ?:)</li>
</ul>

# var vs let vs const
<p> Each of these keywords has its own rules and uses, and it is important to understand the differences between them in order to write effective and maintainable code.</p>
<h2>var</h2>
<p>he var keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. It was introduced in the early days of the language and was the only way to declare variables for a long time. However, the var keyword has some limitations and has been largely replaced by the let and const keywords in modern JavaScript.One of the main issues with var is that it is function-scoped, rather than block-scoped. This means that variables declared with var are accessible within the entire function in which they are declared, rather than just within the block of code in which they appear. This can lead to unexpected behavior and can make it difficult to reason about the scope of variables in your code.</p>
<h2>let</h2>
<p>The let keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) and is used to declare variables that can be reassigned later. let variables are block-scoped, which means that they are only accessible within the block of code in which they are declared. This makes them more predictable and easier to reason about than var variables.</p>
<h2>Conts</h2>
<p>The const keyword was also introduced in ES6 and is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned later. const variables are also block-scoped and behave similarly to let variables in that respect. However, the main difference is that const variables must be initialized with a value when they are declared and cannot be reassigned later.</p>

# conditional
<h2>If else</h2>
<p>he "if" statement in JavaScript is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met. The "else" clause is used to execute a block of code if the condition is not met.</p>
<h2>If else ladder | Nested If</h2>
<p>The "if-else ladder" is a control structure in JavaScript that allows you to execute a different block of code depending on multiple conditions. It is called a ladder because it consists of multiple "if" and "else" statements arranged in a ladder-like fashion.</p>
<h2>Switch Case</h2>
<p>The "switch" statement in JavaScript is another control structure that allows you to execute a different block of code depending on a specific value. It is often used as an alternative to the "if-else ladder" when you have multiple conditions to check against a single value.</p>
<h2>Ternary Operator</h2>
<p>The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write an if-else statement in JavaScript. It takes the form of condition ? value1 : value2, where condition is a boolean expression, and value1 and value2 are expressions of any type. If condition is true, the ternary operator returns value1; if condition is false, it returns value2.</p>
